1. /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
LoginGraceTime 2m
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
#StrictModes yes
MaxAuthTries 6
#MaxSessions 10

PubkeyAuthentication yes

2. sudo systemctl enable nginx.service
3. I need SSH access to do that?
4. /etc/ssh/sshd_config file adding/changing Port 22 to the port that you want (i.e: Port 443) do service ssh restart.
